🧠 Recommendation Techniques Explained
1. Collaborative Filtering

How it works: Analyzes patterns of users with similar movie preferences
Key Approach:

Identifies users who have watched and liked similar movies
Recommends movies that these similar users enjoyed


Strength: Discovers unexpected movie recommendations

2. Content-Based Filtering

How it works: Analyzes individual movie characteristics
Key Approach:

Examines movie attributes like genre, actors, directors
Creates recommendations based on movies similar to user's past preferences


Strength: Provides highly personalized recommendations

3. Hybrid Approach

How it works: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering
Key Approach:

Leverages strengths of both filtering techniques
Provides more accurate and diverse recommendations


Strength: Overcomes limitations of individual methods
